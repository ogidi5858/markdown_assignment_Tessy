#  Aspiring Front-End Developer & Intern

> Hi, I'm Tessy, a driven and detail-oriented intern with a passion for building seamless user experiences. As a **front-end development** enthusiast, I'm actively learning and developing my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I'm excited to expand my knowledge in front-end frameworks and libraries, and I'm eager to apply my skills to real-world projects. Currently, I'm gaining hands-on experience as an *intern*, where I'm learning from experienced professionals and growing my expertise in the field.
